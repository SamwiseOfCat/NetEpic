Release Notes
-------------

*** Version 1.2 ***
This release contains all the files from 1.1, and adds Chaos armies into the mix - therefore the list is now :

* Adeptus Astartes (Space Marines - includes all chapter-specific units)
* Adeptus Mechanicus (Knight Households & Tech-Guard)
* Eldar
* Imperial Guard (and Planetary Defence Forces)
* Necrons (a HIGHLY experimental list with many rules added by myself for NetEpic, as a former 40K Necrons player - use at your own risk)
* Orks
* Squats
* Titan Legions
* Chaos (all four main powers, Undivided & Chaos Space Marines)

It also fixes a multitude of minor errors / optimizations in the other lists including (but not limited to) :

* points costs for various units (Ork Fighta Bommas, Eldar Falcon hosts, etc)
* Morale Values for some units
* Void shield count on the Imperator
* Added the "Floater" rule to main NetEpic .gst file
* Fixed a number of incorrect VP values

New "unique" units have also been added for various races which were missing on the original files - these were featured in official GW channels (White Dwarf, Citadel Journal etc) but some seem a little OP, use if you wish or ignore them.
The next release will hopefully have the limitations on faction-specific units added, but this is tricky to implement given the structure employed so far. As ever, use the rule books to ensure your army choice is "allowed" - this is a 
tool to aid in force composition and is not intended to be a replacement for actually using the rule books ;-)

*** Version 1.1 ***
This release contains the main Game System (.gst) file and multiple Army Lists Catalogue files (.cat). The armies covered are :

* Adeptus Astartes (Space Marines)
* Adeptus Mechanicus (Knight Households & Tech-Guard)
* Eldar
* Imperial Guard (and Planetary Defence Forces)
* Necrons (a HIGHLY experimental list with many rules added by myself for NetEpic, as a former 40K Necrons player)
* Orks
* Squats
* Titan Legions

Further releases for Chaos, Tyranids, Dark Eldar and Tau will follow at a later date - Chaos and Tau will be in Version 1.2 in the next month or so. Other "niche" armies (Slann, Exodites etc) will be added as and when there is enough demand. 
The vast majority of units for the Army Files included in V1.1 are already there - anything that was "officially" released in either the NetEpic Army books or the GW Expansions (Armies Of The Imperium, Renegades, Warlords) is present, 
along with some other units that only ever appeared in White Dwarf or other publications. I have listed the publications next to those units in the datafiles when ive remembered, and only when they are not from the main "canon" sources listed above. 
The main exception to this is the Necrons list, of which about 20% was from the NetEpic lists and the rest were entirely created by me, so use at your own risk.... they appear to be balanced on paper though.

Revision notes and reasoning behind the code applied / naming conventions etc can be read on the master "Comment" for the GS file, viewable with the BS Data Editor.


Known Bugs / Improvements In The Pipeline
-----------------------------------------

#1: One current issue that I am already aware of that needs fixing in that the army builder will force you to have one Company Card (as you'd expect) but does not then enforce only 5 Support Cards per Company, or only 1 Special Card per Company. This will be fixed in Version 1.2.

#2:  Faction-specific cards are not prohibited by the code - YET - but will be soon, maybe not for Version 1.2 though. In the meantime, the limitations on Faction-specific cards are made clear by text "Rules" applied to each Force Organisation, 
as well as Prohibited units that named Factions cant take, so anyone with any experience of list-building with cards will be able to easily identify faction-specific units in a list where they shouldnt be...

Please feel free to email me with any issues you find in the lists - typos, incorrect points values, missing stats etc and I will add them to a list to get fixed in the next release. All feedback is welcome - please use stagletto at gmail dot com and ill get back to you when I can.

Enjoy!

Steve
