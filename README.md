Release Notes
-------------
v7 notes :
Final release before publishing to NetEpic.org. 

v6 notes :
Final fixes to main GST file.

v5 notes :

Yes I know v4 notes didnt get added :-) This is hopefully the final release as there will presumably be no NetEpic / SM 2nd Ed armies to add, and also hopefully because there arent any glaring errors in the lists ive made. It is a BIG release which has been a LOT of work, and in conjunction with v4 it adds :

    Dark Eldar
    Slann / Exodus / Dracon
    Harlequin Masques / Exodites
    Chaos
    Sisters Of Battle
    Tyranids

It also changes the way you pay for weapons on Titans, as well as the way VP is awarded for them which seems a lot fairer. This will result in the odd "fraction" value in adding up VP though, a small price to pay. Hopefully people out there find it useful, its been a labour of love getting all this done (and in some cases less "love" more "urgghhhh").

Cheers - Steve


v3 notes :

This release adds Tau to the list of races you can now build armies for in Battlescribe! I can hear the handful of Tau NetEpic players out there whooping from here. This list caters for "pure" Tau and also Kroot Mercenary armies.
There is also a multitude of minor fixes for small data errors ive noticed including but not limited to :
*Added Off Board / Orbital Barrage rule
*Amended wording of Forward Observer rule
*Added Transport (8) / Transport (24) rules
*Added Turret rule
*Categorizations added for multiple races / specific unit types
Faction-specific limitations are still not ready (apologies, I am a very busy person with a 2 year old chaos monkey in my house) so players will have to simply be careful to pick legitimate forces when selecting Codex-specific lists. 


v2 notes :

Added "Unique" Shared Rule to account for unique units.
Any Titan weapons over 100 points have had an extra VP added to their profile to account for the increased points cost to field them (base VP is accounted for in Titan base profile on presumption that the Titan will field weapons of 50-100 points in each slot).


v1 notes :

This release contains the main Game System (.gst) file and multiple Army Lists Catalogue files (.cat). The armies covered are :

* Adeptus Astartes (Space Marines)
* Adeptus Mechanicus (Knight Households & Tech-Guard)
* Eldar
* Imperial Guard (and Planetary Defence Forces)
* Necrons (a HIGHLY experimental list with many rules added by myself for NetEpic, as a former 40K Necrons player)
* Orks
* Squats
* Titan Legions

Further releases for Chaos, Tyranids, Dark Eldar and Tau will follow at a later date - Chaos and Tau will be in Version 1.2 in the next month or so. Other "niche" armies (Slann, Exodites etc) will be added as and when there is enough demand. The vast majority of units for the Army Files included in V1.1 are already there - anything that was "officially" released in either the NetEpic Army books or the GW Expansions (Armies Of The Imperium, Renegades, Warlords) is present, along with some other units that only ever appeared in White Dwarf or other publications. I have listed the publications next to those units in the datafiles when ive remembered, and only when they are not from the main "canon" sources listed above. The main exception to this is the Necrons list, of which about 20% was from the NetEpic lists and the rest were entirely created by me, so use at your own risk.... they appear to be balanced on paper though.

Revision notes and reasoning behind the code applied / naming conventions etc can be read on the master "Comment" for the GS file, viewable with the BS Data Editor.


Known Bugs / Improvements In The Pipeline
-----------------------------------------

#1: One current issue that I am already aware of that needs fixing in that the army builder will force you to have one Company Card (as you'd expect) but does not then enforce only 5 Support Cards per Company, or only 1 Special Card per Company. This will be fixed in Version 1.2.

#2:  Faction-specific cards are not prohibited by the code - YET - but will be soon, maybe not for Version 1.2 though. In the meantime, the limitations on Faction-specific cards are made clear by text "Rules" applied to each Force Organisation, as well as Prohibited units that named Factions cant take, so anyone with any experience of list-building with cards will be able to easily identify faction-specific units in a list where they shouldnt be...
